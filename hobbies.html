        <h2>My main Hobby right now is my family. Whatever I do I do for them!</h2>
        <p>I am a father of three children and have a beautiful wife. So when I find time to do one of my sport hobbies, I
            do it together with my children. Which is great fun because they are at the beautiful ages of 4, 5, and 7.
        They are my inspiration and motivation. Obviously, I love learning new things, and IT is giving me so many areas that I can explore.</p>
